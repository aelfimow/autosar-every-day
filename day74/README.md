RAM Test: Fault Models (p. 89)
* Low Coverage: 60%
* Medium Coverage: 90%
* High Coverage: 99%

RAM Test: Description (p. 90)
* located in MCAL
* foreground test: synchronous test methods
* background test: asynchronous test methods

RAM Test: Detection and Reaction (p. 90)
* reports errors as production errors

RAM Test: Limitations (p. 90)
* Transient faults and intermittent faults are not covered
* Execution of RAM Test may be limited to the power-up/sleep/shutdown phase
