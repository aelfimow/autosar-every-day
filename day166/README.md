Software Clusters in Classic Platform (p. 11)

Software Clusters in a nutshell (p. 11)
* Hierarchy of `ECUs`, Machines and Software Clusters in a vehicle topology
* One `ECU` can have 1 to N microcontrollers
* Each Machine owns one `BSW` Stack
* from AUTOSAR perspective it is an instance of a Classic Platform Architecture
* hypervisors are not standardized by AUTOSAR
* Each Software Cluster is an independent Build Unit
* Software Cluster Connection in AUTOSAR Layered Software Architecture (p. 13)
* Software Cluster Connection
* three major sub-blocks: Binary Manifest, Cross Cluster Communication, Proxy Modules
* Host Software Cluster (p. 14)
