# Day 143

* From AUTOSAR\_EXP\_AIChassis.pdf

Glossary (p. 18)

Differences between SW-Components and `ECU`s (p. 19)

Functional safety (p. 19)
* Chassis Domain: No specification of reliable communication
* On project level: safety concept

Concept of core-, conditional- and optional- ports (p. 19)

Concept of sensors (p. 20)

Concept of sensors: Internal state sensors (p. 20)
* `Raw signal`: hardware dependent
* `Base signal`: Abstraction of sensor hardware
* `Standard signal`: Derived from `Base signals` according to AUTOSAR specification
* `Fused signal`: derived from several sensor signals

Concept of sensors: Surrounding sensors (p. 20)
* `Fused signals` are standardized only

Limitations (p. 20)
