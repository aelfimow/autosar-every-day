# Day 164

* From AUTOSAR\_EXP\_AIPowerTrain.pdf

Differences between `SW-Cs` and `ECUs` (p. 28)

Functional safety (p. 28)
* `RTE` will provide reliable communication
* AUTOSAR does not provide a Safety Concept for Powertrain systems

`PTC` Composition (`PtCoorr`) (p. 28)
* not an atomic `SW-C`

Definition of overboost (p. 28)
* a state in which the maximum torque, which the combustion engine can deliver, is increased for a limited period of time

Coordination at the vehicle level (p. 29)

`PTC` Arbitration between Driver and Chassis torque requests (p. 29)

Assumptions on modeling style and naming aspects specific for powertrain domain (p. 30)

In most cases it is very difficult to explain the difference between `State` and `Status` (p. 33)
